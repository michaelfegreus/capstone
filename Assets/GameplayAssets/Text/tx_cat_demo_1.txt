Well...hello. I haven't seen a human here in a long time.
And it seems like you've made yourself quite at home.
Well, why don't you take the key then. I think you'll find the house quite comfortable.
You may be here for a while, after all.
Oh, and give that seed a good home too. That is, if you're interested in leaving here ever.
